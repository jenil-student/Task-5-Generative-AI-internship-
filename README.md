# Neural Style Transfer (Task 5)

This project demonstrates neural style transfer using TensorFlow and Streamlit.

## Features
- Upload a content image and a style image.
- The app applies the artistic style of the style image to the content image using a VGG19-based neural style transfer model.
- View the stylized output directly in the browser.

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Start the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run neural_style_transfer.py
   ```
3. Upload a content image and a style image, then view the stylized result.
